This is a simple Qt core application. It has no GUI and uses only the Qt Core, 
and Qt Network libraries. The application implements a simple TCP/IP echo 
server. Once started, the server simply echos back whatever is said it. 
The project presents a simple demonstration of how to implement a TCP/IP
server and how to create a simple Qt Core application.
