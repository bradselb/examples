This is a quick and very messy hacked-to-life example of how to use the 
serial port with QT. I just sat down one Sunday afternoon and kinda shit 
this out while reading the QT docs on the QSerialPort class. 

I needed something that would spew on the serial port so for this example, 
I connected and Adafruit Ultimate GPS module to my computer with a USB-Serial 
cable (also available from Adafruit). 

Note that the QSerialPort class is not included by default in Debian's QT dev
support. I had to...
   sudo apt-get install libqt5serialport5 libqt5serialport5-dev

note also that ordinary users do not have privs with the serial ports so...
   sudo adduser brad dialout


Here are a few ideas for where this will be further developed...
   -- GPS Clock with Qt UI
   -- Simple GPS receiver thingy with Qt GUI.
   -- Luxury GPS data logger
   -- APRS ??? hmmm.... ???
