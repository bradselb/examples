note that the executable is completely independent of the library.
the two can be build separately and for example, expanding the library 
does not require the executable to be re-built. 

---compile and link the executable:
gcc -rdynamic -o tryfuncs tryfuncs.c -ldl

--- it can be verified that the executable doe snot depend upon the library...
ldd tryfuncs


building the library is a multi-step process...
first compile the various source files....
gcc -c -fpic -o funcs.o funcs.c 

---- then, link
gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libfuncs.so -o libfuncs.so.1 -lc funcs.o
  --- or ---
ld -shared -soname libfuncs.so -o libfuncs.so.1 -lc funcs.o 


--- finally, it seems necessary to advise the loader of the new dynamically linked library 
sudo ldconfig -v -n /home/bselbrede/examples/shared/
